Calculate SDG 15.3.1
===============================
**Sustainable Development Goal 15.3** intends to combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by 
desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030. In order to assess the progress 
to this goal, the agreed-upon indicator for SDG 15.3 (proportion of land area degraded) is a combination of three sub-indicators: 
change in ``land productivity``, change in ``land cover`` and change in ``soil organic carbon``.
